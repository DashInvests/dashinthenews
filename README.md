# Why are we collecting this Data?

For the last 5 years data and information on Dash has been hard to find.  This is an attempt to collect as much of the public Dash media information as it (Dash) becomes more widely known in the main stream financial circles due to its unique financial, social and technological feature set.  

Data collected in a repository format can be used to automate alot of information analysis going forward
